## 🖼️ Collage Images Setup

All images used in the **collage page** are stored inside the `pic-src` folder.

The `collage.html` file already contains image links in the following format:

pic-src/photo1.jpg
pic-src/photo2.jpg
…

### To customize the collage:
1. Add your own images to the `pic-src` folder  
2. Rename them to match the existing placeholders  
   **OR**
3. Update the image paths inside `collage.html` to match your filenames  

No additional configuration is required.

## 🎶 Playlist Page Setup

The `playlist.html` page contains a placeholder link:

PLAYLIST_LINK_HERE

### To add your own playlist:
1. Open `playlist.html`
2. Replace `PLAYLIST_LINK_HERE` with your playlist URL  
   (Spotify, YouTube, Apple Music, etc.)
3. Save and reload the page
